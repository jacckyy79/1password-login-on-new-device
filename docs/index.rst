Why You Need to Log In Again
============================

1Password uses a **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**, meaning your data is encrypted locally and can only be decrypted with your **Secret Key** and **Master Password**. Because of this, logging into your 1Password account on a new device requires re-authentication.

This is a critical security measure to:

- Prevent unauthorized access
- Ensure your vaults sync securely
- Protect your Master Password and vault items

Requirements Before Logging In
==============================

To successfully complete a **1Password login on a new device**, you will need the following:

1. **Your 1Password Account Email**
2. **Your Secret Key** – Found in your Emergency Kit (PDF or printed copy)
3. **Your Master Password**
4. (Optional) **Two-Factor Authentication Code** – If you’ve enabled 2FA

These credentials are essential because they authenticate you as the legitimate owner of the 1Password account.

Step-by-Step: How to Log Into 1Password on a New Device
=======================================================

Follow these steps to log into 1Password on a new device:

**Step 1: Install the 1Password App or Visit the Web Portal**

- Desktop: Go to `https://1password.com/downloads <https://1password.com/downloads>`_ and install the app for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Mobile: Download the app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
- Web: Visit `https://my.1password.com <https://my.1password.com>`_ using a secure browser.

**Step 2: Click on “Sign In”**

- On the app or web interface, tap or click **Sign In** to begin the authentication process.

**Step 3: Enter Your Credentials**

Provide the following:

- **Email Address**
- **Secret Key** (copy/paste from your Emergency Kit)
- **Master Password**

**Step 4: Verify Identity (If 2FA is Enabled)**

- Open your authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Authy)
- Enter the 6-digit verification code

**Step 5: Access Granted**

Once verified, you will have full access to your vaults and stored credentials on the new device.

What is the Emergency Kit?
==========================

When you first create a 1Password account, you are provided with a downloadable Emergency Kit (PDF). This file contains:

- Your 1Password account email
- Your Secret Key
- The web address for login
- A space to write down your Master Password

Keep this file stored securely — not in your 1Password account itself — as it is essential for setting up **1Password login on a new device**.

Tips for First-Time Setup on New Devices
========================================

- **Use a Secure Network**: Avoid logging in over public Wi-Fi.
- **Don’t Save Passwords in Browsers**: Let 1Password manage your credentials.
- **Enable Biometric Access**: Set up Touch ID or Face ID after login for added security.
- **Enable Autofill**: Allow 1Password to fill passwords automatically for convenience.

Syncing Vaults on the New Device
================================

After logging in, 1Password will sync all your existing vaults to the new device automatically. This includes:

- Personal vaults
- Shared or family vaults
- Notes, documents, and stored credentials

Changes made on the new device will also sync to all other connected devices.

Common Issues and Troubleshooting
=================================

**Issue: "Secret Key Not Recognized"**

- Double-check that you're entering the correct Secret Key from your Emergency Kit
- Be mindful of uppercase and lowercase letters

**Issue: Can't Access Email for Verification**

- Use a device you're still signed into to update your email address
- Contact 1Password Support if access is lost

**Issue: Two-Factor Authentication Failure**

- Ensure your mobile device time is set to automatic
- Use backup codes or recovery options if available

**Issue: Forgot Secret Key or Master Password**

- You can retrieve the Secret Key from a trusted device where you’re already signed in
- If both are lost and no trusted devices remain, account recovery may be impossible

Security Measures When Using a New Device
=========================================

- Always **sign out** if the device is shared
- Set up a **lock screen timeout** within the app
- Turn on **remote wipe** or device tracking (via your OS settings)
- Avoid storing your credentials in unsecured locations

Logging Out and Revoking Access
===============================

If you no longer wish to use 1Password on the new device or it gets stolen:

1. Log in to your 1Password account on another trusted device
2. Navigate to **My Profile > Devices**
3. Revoke access for the compromised or lost device

This ensures your data stays secure and inaccessible to others.

Additional Setup for Teams or Families
======================================

If you're part of a **1Password Family, Team, or Business account**, additional setup may be required:

- Request device approval from your administrator
- Accept shared vault invitations again
- Reconfigure permissions based on roles

Conclusion
==========

Setting up your **1Password login on a new device** is a vital process to ensure continuous access to your sensitive information while maintaining the highest levels of security. By keeping your Secret Key and Master Password safe, and using 2FA, you can securely access your vaults on any device, anywhere in the world.
